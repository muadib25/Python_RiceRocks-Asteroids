# Python_RiceRocks-Asteroids

An Asteroids clone game I did on Python, during a Coursera Interactive Python course via Rice University. The game runs at the 
moment via the Codeskulptor.org page, although there are plans to use a Python Library like PyGame or similar in the future. 

To view the code in action and/or play the game just go to www.codeskulptor.org and paste the code on the left window, followed by 
clicking on the 'Play' button located on the panel's top-left side.

Or you can just visit this page: https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user49_H5SdINOQa4_168.py



Have fun!
